🧠 What is an RNN?

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network designed to handle sequential data.
Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs have a memory of previous inputs, making them well-suited for tasks where the order of data matters.

📌 Example

Imagine predicting the next word in a sentence:
Input: “I am going to the …”
The RNN processes each word sequentially, keeping track of the context. By the time it sees “the”, it uses its memory of earlier words (“I am going to”) to predict “store” or “park”.

✅ Advantages
	•	Good at handling sequential/temporal data (text, speech, time series).
	•	Shares weights across time steps → fewer parameters.

⸻

⚠️ Challenges
	•	Vanishing / Exploding Gradients: Long sequences make it hard for RNNs to learn dependencies far back in time.
	•	Slow training compared to feedforward networks.
	•	Limited memory of long-term dependencies.

⸻

🔧 Solutions & Variants
	•	LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Adds gates (input, forget, output) to manage long-term memory.
	•	GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): A simpler version of LSTM, also effective at remembering longer contexts.
	•	Bidirectional RNNs: Process sequences in both directions for more context.
	•	Attention / Transformers: Modern architectures that overcome RNN limitations.

⸻

🌟 Applications
	•	Natural Language Processing (translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition).
	•	Time Series Forecasting (stock prices, weather).
	•	Sequential event modeling (IoT, medical data).

👉 In short: RNNs are neural networks with memory, designed for sequential data.
