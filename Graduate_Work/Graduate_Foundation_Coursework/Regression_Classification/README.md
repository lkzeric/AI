üåü Neural Networks: The Basics

A neural network is a computational model inspired by the brain. It‚Äôs made up of layers of connected ‚Äúneurons,‚Äù where each neuron applies a simple mathematical operation. By stacking many layers together, the network can model very complex relationships in data.

Neural networks can be applied to two common tasks in machine learning: regression and classification.

üìà Neural Networks for Regression
	‚Ä¢	Goal: Predict a continuous value (a number).
	‚Ä¢	Example: Estimating the price of a house based on its size, location, and age.
	‚Ä¢	How it works:
	‚Ä¢	The network takes input features (like square footage or number of bedrooms).
	‚Ä¢	Neurons process these features through weighted sums and nonlinear activation functions.
	‚Ä¢	The output layer usually has one neuron with no activation function (or a linear one), so it can predict a real-valued number.
	‚Ä¢	Loss function: Common choices are Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which measure how far predictions are from true values.

üè∑Ô∏è Neural Networks for Classification
	‚Ä¢	Goal: Predict a category or class label.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Classifying whether an image contains a cat, dog, or bird.
	‚Ä¢	How it works:
	‚Ä¢	The input goes through multiple hidden layers (just like in regression).
	‚Ä¢	The output layer has one neuron per class. For example, 3 neurons for [cat, dog, bird].
	‚Ä¢	A softmax activation is applied in the output layer, converting raw scores into probabilities that sum to 1.
	‚Ä¢	Loss function: The most common is cross-entropy loss, which measures how well predicted probabilities match the true labels.

üîë Key Differences

Aspect	Regression	Classification
Output	Single continuous number	One or more class probabilities
Output Activation	Linear (or none)	Softmax (multiclass) / Sigmoid (binary)
Loss Function	MSE, MAE	Cross-entropy
Example	Predict house price	Predict if an email is spam or not

‚úÖ Why Use Neural Networks?
	‚Ä¢	They can capture nonlinear relationships that simple models (like linear regression) might miss.
	‚Ä¢	With enough layers and data, they can approximate very complex functions.
	‚Ä¢	They‚Äôre flexible: the same underlying structure can be adapted to many tasks (images, text, time series, etc.).
